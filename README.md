# Browsernative Microservices

## Abstract

Building complex web applications requires additional layers of abstraction
and often heavily depends on indispensable frameworks. While those smartly
bypass the global paradigm of the DOM, they remain highly proprietary
pieces of technology. New w3c specifications built into the browser provide
a native service API in the need of standardized web components for the
browser. In 2017 prospectively all major browsers will implement those
technologies. The paper not only provides a brief and practical introduction
into these new specifications. Furthermore, as an assessment criteria, it
matches those specifications with the concept of microservices, which is a
modular system architecture for building scalable applications.
